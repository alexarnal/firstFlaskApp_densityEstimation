I followed the following videos in the making of this project:

* https://youtu.be/75-oCKUx3oU – PythonAnywhere didn't workout for me so I moved on to the next video
* https://youtu.be/Z1RJmh_OqeA – Heavily guided the development of this project
* https://youtu.be/sy1MNWt7om4 – Helped with the download of output files
* https://youtu.be/627VBkAhKTc – First video I saw but I got confused (maybe becuase it was the first time I saw this) but I used the gui layout from this video
